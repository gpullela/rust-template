# devcontainer.json
This file is used to configure the dev environment on codespaces, similar to how a dockerfile is used to 
describe the specifications for a required container (which can also be used in conjunction with a devcontainer).

If the .devcontainer folder with a devcontainer.json file is present in your repository, you can deploy a codespace 
right from your repository page, by clicking on the code dropdown and navigating to codespaces (which will use said file).

By pre-configuring extensions and the specifications for your OS and programming language, there is little to no pre-development 
configuration required, unlike typical setups where you would install the requirements for a language, an editor, and other useful tools, making it so that you can focus on programming.
